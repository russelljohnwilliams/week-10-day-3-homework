Purpose
-------

Allows for the dynamic wrapping of objects in order to modify their existing responsibilities and behaviors.

Use When
--------

* Object responsibilities and behaviors should be dynamically modifiable.
* Concrete implementations should be decoupled from responsibilities and behaviors.
* Subclassing to achieve modification is impractical or impossible.
* Specific functionality should not reside high in the object hierarchy.
* A lot of little objects surrounding a concrete implementation is acceptable.
